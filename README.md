# Heap and Graph Traversal Project

## Overview
This project includes implementations of:
- Heapsort using iterative max-heapify
- Graph traversal algorithms (BFS and DFS) with paths between cities

## Usage
1. **Heapsort**:
   - Run `heapsort` on a list to sort it.

2. **Graph Traversal**:
   - Load cities from `cities.txt` and find paths between cities using BFS and DFS.

## Example Commands
```python
python main.py
